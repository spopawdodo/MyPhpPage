DONE :
-> logout action
-> change Password
-> change Email
-> delete account
-> upload files
-> rename tables + columns(camelcase)
-> encrypt file name ( partially)
-> md5
-> separate picture display from controller ( create a view function)
-> delete user -> delete user file
               -> works if user has no files uploaded
               -> delete file from directory
-> display files in view mode
-> download
-> alter table -> add column extension
-> change model functions
-> bootstrap
-> add picture description
-> add admin -> database column
             -> home page
-> autoloader -> quick fix : moved the templates folder to the View Folder
              -> another fix : add a __DIR__ prefix
->controller class -> checkController + controller + fileController + formController
-> delete account -> remove file from directory
-> admin -> privileges -> delete file
                        & download file
                        & delete user
-> user can only delete HIS pictures, admin can delete any picture
-> (solved)  problem with deletePicture from admin :-> the delete query returns true even if it didn t delete any file
        (partially solved because you can t delete a picture that doesn't exit)
-> index php -> turn switch to a new class -> returns class name + callable ( function  name )
-> add picture description filter / censorship :
        * transform word to w**d
        * strip text : t.e.!xt to text
        * transform '0' to 'o', @ to a
        * see if non-letter character is actually a punctuation sign
TO DO:

* add picture description filter / censorship


    I want. to p.u.n.c.h. yo!u damn.. wh0re.

* trait
